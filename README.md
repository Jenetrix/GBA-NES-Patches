# GBA-NES-Patches
DRM+SRAM Patches for the GBA NES and Famicom games. For use with Flashcarts & GBA Multi Game Menu

Notes: 
* Original IPS patches these are based off of gathered from GBATemp, Filetrip (via Wayback Machine), 5ch. Original authors unknown.
* Whoever made the original DRM patch for Pac-Man (JP) based it off of the overdumped (4mb) rom. If you run into bugs with this patch use the US version instead.
* Japanese versions of Zelda 1, Excitebike, Bomberman, and Xevious do not have any DRM. These have only been SRAM patched.
* If you want nice GBA Multi Menu backgrounds to use with these, go look [here](https://www.deviantart.com/jenetrix/gallery/89918060/gba-multimenu-backgrounds)
